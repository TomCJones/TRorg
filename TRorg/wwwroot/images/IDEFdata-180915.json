Website USER do-not-track requests are an example of a USER request. An example of a site that handles responses to Do Not Track (DNT) requests in this manner is Medium.com which sends a single popup to new users, whether or not they are registered, about how they will handle the DNT request.<\/p>\n<p>As a general principle, consent choices or other similar must-see-this-first information should be exchanged in a first encounter, and then honored in and presented in a consistent manner thereafter.<\/p>\n<p>Suggested ways for User Experience mitigation includes using pop-up boxes or email responses to user requests. Links to information regarding additional use should provide adequate time for users to read the information presented to them.<\/p>\n<p>The entity gathering requests should state whether identity information is being used, and the user must be notified.<\/p>\n<p>Please note that the\u00a0<a title=\"Baseline Functional Requirements v1.0\" href=\"https:\/\/wiki.idesg.org\/wiki\/index.php?title=Baseline_Functional_Requirements_v1.0#Privacy\">IDESG Privacy Requirements<\/a>\u00a0apply to these interactions and the data they generate.<\/p>\n<p class='welcome-text'>REFERENCES<\/p><p>More information about Do Not Track can be found at these links: FTC website on Do Not Track:\u00a0<a class=\"external free\" href=\"https:\/\/www.ftc.gov\/news-events\/media-resources\/protectingconsumer-privacy\/do-not-track\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:\/\/www.ftc.gov\/news-events\/media-resources\/protectingconsumer-privacy\/do-not-track<\/a>\u00a0Do Not Track standard work at the W3C:\u00a0<a class=\"external free\" href=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2011\/tracking-protection\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2011\/tracking-protection\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p class='welcome-text'>APPLIES TO ROLES<\/p><p>TBA<\/p>\n"
